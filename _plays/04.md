title: 採用敏捷、遞迴方式以開發服務
---
我們必須用一個漸進、快速的軟體開發形式來降低失敗風險，這是藉著讓軟體快速到達使用者的手上、以及頻繁的提供機會讓交付任務團隊能調整需求，並根據對人們使用原型和實際軟體的觀察，來修訂開發計畫。關鍵能力是自動化測試與服務配置，讓新功能可以經常加入並且輕易投入產品中。採用敏捷方式，已經證實是建立數位服務的最佳實踐，這也將讓我們更有能力建立有效吻合使用者需求的服務。

We should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure by getting working software into users’ hands quickly, and by providing frequent opportunities for the delivery team members to adjust requirements and development plans based on watching people use prototypes and real software. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and easily put into production. Following agile methodologies is a proven best practice for building digital services, and will increase our ability to build services that effectively meet user needs.

#### 檢查表

1. 儘快提供一個能正常運作最低可行產品以解決服務核心用戶需求，時間需在任何新數位計畫開始的三個月內。需要的話，設立**Beta測試期**。
2. 經常進行可用度測試，來檢視服務對用戶來說是否運作良好，以及確認應作哪些改善
3. 確保建立服務的成員間彼此保持密切聯繫，包括使用像是作戰情報室、每日站立會議還有群組聊天工具等技巧。
4. 保持一個小而專注的交付團隊；減少區隔團隊與業主間的組織層級。
5. 每個月多次釋出功能和改善。
6. 建立功能與臭蟲的優先順序清單，這通常又稱作 "未完成功能清單" 以及 "未清除臭蟲清單"
7. 使用項目追蹤工具將功能與臭蟲編目
8. 使用源碼版本管理工具
9. 確保整個團隊都能存取項目追蹤和版本管理工具
10. 進行代碼審查來確保品質

#### checklist
1. Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need addressed by the service as soon as possible, and not longer than three months from the beginning of any new digital project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed
2. Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works for users, and identify improvements that should be made
3. Ensure the individuals building the service are in close communication using techniques such as war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools
4. Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
5. Release features and improvements multiple times each month
6. Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”
7. Use an “issue tracker” to catalog features and bugs
8. Use a source code version control system
9. Ensure entire team has access to the issue tracker and version control system
10. Use code reviews to ensure quality

#### 關鍵問題
- 完成最低可行產品需要多久？如果現在還沒完成，什麼時候可以完成？
- 產品配置要多久？
- 每個遞迴/衝刺大約是多少天？
- 這使用了哪個源碼版本管理系統？
- 用了哪個工具追蹤臭蟲與議題？
- 用了哪個工具來管理未完成功能清單？
- 你有多常回顧、重排未完成功能以及未清除臭蟲清單項目的優先順序？
- 在開發時，你如何收集使用者的回饋？這些回饋又是如何改善服務的？
- 在每個階段的可用度測試中，有找出哪些在解決用戶需求上的差距？

#### key questions
- How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it has not shipped yet, when will it?
- How long does it take for a production deployment?
- How long in days are the iterations/sprints?
- Which source code version control system is being used?
- What tool is being used to track bugs and issue tickets?
- What tool is being used to manage the feature backlog?
- How often do you review and reprioritize the items in your feature and bug backlog?
- How do you collect user feedback during development and how is that feedback to improve the service?
- At each stage of usability testing, what gaps were identified in addressing user needs?
