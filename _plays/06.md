title: 指派一位領導者，並且要求其負責
---

在組內只能有一位產品負責人有權並負責指派任務與工作項目、作業務、產品以及技術決策、以及對整個服務的成敗負全責。這個負責人將對服務如何能吻合使用者需求負有完全責任，吻合使用者需求也應是評估服務的方式。產品負責人有責任確保功能均有建立，並管理功能和臭蟲清單。

There must be a single product owner who has the authority and responsibility across teams to assign tasks and work elements; make business, product, and technical decisions; and is accountable for the success or failure of the overall service. This product owner is ultimately responsible for how well the service is meeting the needs of its users, which is how a service should be evaluated. The product owner is responsible for ensuring the features are built and managing the feature and bug backlogs.
