title: 了解人們需要什麼
---

我們必須以探索並確立服務使用者的需求，還有該服務將如何融入他們生活中，來開始一項數位計畫。無論使用者是公眾還是政府雇員，政策制定者需在一開始便將真正參與的人納入設計過程中。技術與設計決定應該取決於人們的需求，而不是受政府筒倉式的結構（譯註：指一個個獨立而互不相關的單位）所限。我們需要以真實的人持續的測試建立出來的成品，來讓我們誠實面對最重要的事物。

We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways in which the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the very beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should drive technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.

#### 檢查表
1. 在計畫初期，花時間和現在與可能服務用戶討論
2. 使用各種定性與定量用戶研究方法來決定人們的目標、需求和行為。在所花費時間上多費心。
3. 與真實的人測試各種可能解法的原型，可能的話在現地進行
4. 紀錄所發現的使用者目標、需求、行為和偏好
5. 將發現與團隊或機構分享
6. 創造使用者故事優先清單，那是一項對使用者試圖完成的目標設想而寫出的簡短敘述
7. 當數位服務建立後，以潛在用戶規律的測試這項服務以確保它將會符合未來的需求

#### checklist
1. Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
2. Use a range of qualitative and quantitative user research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
3. Test prototypes of possible solutions with real people, in the field if possible
4. Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
5. Share findings with the team and agency leadership
6. Create a prioritized list of user stories, which are short descriptions of the goals the user is trying to accomplish
7. As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it will meet peoples’ needs

#### 關鍵問題
- 這項服務將解決哪些用戶需求？
- 為什麼用戶想要/需要這項服務？
- 關鍵用戶是哪些人？
- 那種人會在使用服務時遇到最多困難？
- 用什麼研究方法？
- 這些發現會如何建檔？未來團隊成員將如何取得這些檔案？
- 要多頻繁的與真實的人進行測試？

#### key questions
- What user needs will this service address?
- Why does the user want or need this service?
- Who are your key users?
- Which people will have the most difficulty with your service?
- What research methods were used?
- What were the key findings from users’ current experience?
- How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
- How often are you testing with real people?
