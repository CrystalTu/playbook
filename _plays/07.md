title: 導入有經驗的團隊
---

我們需要有才能、有創造現代數位服務經驗的人在政府內工作。這包括導入有經驗的產品經理、工程師以及設計師。當需要外部協助時，我們團隊應與訂約官合作，他了解該如何評估第三方技術能力，所以團隊能和擅長建立與交付有效率數位服務的承包商配對。團隊的組成與經驗需求將因計畫的範圍而異。

We need talented people working in government who have experience creating modern digital services. This includes bringing in seasoned product managers, engineers, and designers. When outside help is needed, our teams should work with contracting officers who understand how to evaluate third-party technical competency so our teams can be paired with contractors who are good at both building and delivering effective digital services. The makeup and experience requirements of the team will vary depending on the scope of the project.
