title: 佈署在彈性的托管環境
---
我們的服務必須佈署在彈性的架構下，讓資源可以即時提供來因應使用者需求的變化。當數位服務托管主機位於"雲端"資料中心，但事實上我們得自己管理並維護硬體時，便顯得寸步難行。這過時的作法不但浪費時間，削弱災害回復計畫，也會需要花費更高的成本。

Our services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real time to meet spikes in user demand. Our digital services are crippled when we host them in data centers which market themselves as “cloud hosting” but require us to manage and maintain hardware directly. This outdated practice wastes time, weakens our disaster recovery plans, and results in significantly higher costs.

#### 檢查表

1. 資源因應需求提供
2. 基於即時使用者需求調整資源規模
3. 資源藉由API提供
4. 用多少、付多少
5. 以內容傳遞網路提供固態資源
6. 以商用硬體托管應用服務

#### checklist
1. Resources are provisioned on demand
2. Resources scale based on real-time user demand
3. Resources are provisioned through an API
4. Resources are available in multiple regions
5. We pay only for the resources we use
6. Static assets are served through a content delivery network
7. Application is hosted on commodity hardware

#### 關鍵問題
- 你的服務將會在哪裡代管？
- 你要用什麼硬體來運行服務？
- 服務的需求與使用量狀況是如何？
- 如果流量或者使用量大幅增加，你的服務會如何？
- 你的託管環境有多大資源容量？
- 供應新資源（像是新的應用伺服器）需要多少時間？
- 你會如何設計服務來基於需求作調整？
- 你的託管架構是如何計費？以分、時、日、月、還是固定制？
- 你的服務會在多地區/區域/資料中心託管嗎？
- 如果資料中心遇上大規模災害，你的服務需要多久才能恢復運作？
- 如果下線時間延長，會造成什麼影響？
- 你需要找託管提供者來取得資源或解決問題的頻率有多高？

#### key questions
-	Where is your service hosted?
-	What hardware does your service use to run?
-	What is the demand / usage pattern for your service?
-	What happens to your service when it experiences a surge in traffic or load?
-	How much capacity is available in your hosting environment?
-	How long does it take you to provision a new resource such as an application server?
-	How have you designed your service to scale based on demand?
-	How are you paying for your hosting infrastructure — i.e., by the minute, hourly, daily, monthly, fixed?
-	Is your service hosted in multiple regions / availability zones / data centers?
-	In the event of a catastrophic disaster to a datacenter, how long will it take to have the service operational?
-	What would be the impact of a prolonged downtime window?
-	What data redundancy do you have built into the system, and what would be the impact of a catastrophic data loss?
-	How often do you need to contact a person from your hosting provider to get resources or to fix an issue?
