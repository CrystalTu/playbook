title: 以可重複使用的程序來管理安全與隱私 Manage security and privacy through reusable processes
---

我們的數位服務必須保護敏感資料並維持系統安全是一大關鍵。通常是一連串的審查和改進，必須建構在服務開發與維護中。在設計一項新服務或特徵時，小組長需要讓合適的隱私、安全或法律官員參與，討論這會收集哪些資訊、如何保證安全，以及資訊將會如何使用及分享。維持隱私專家的參與能確保個人資料能適當的管理。除此之外，建構安全服務的一項關鍵步驟是徹底的測試並認證每一層技術堆棧中的元件裡，有哪些安全漏洞，以及重複使用這些已認證後的元件在多項其他服務中。

以下檢查表提供一個開頭，但個小組應和組內的隱私專家與安全工程師密切合作，來滿足特定服務的需求。

It is critical that our digital services protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.

The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.

#### 檢查表

#### checklist
1. Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted
2. Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept
3. Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach
4. Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service
5. “Pre-certify” the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP
6. Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable

#### 關鍵問題

#### key questions
- Does the service collect personal information from the user (whether government or public)?  How is the user notified of this collection?
- Does it collect more information than is needed to perform the requested task? Are there uses of the data that would not be expected by the average user?
- How does a user contact a responsible person to seek access, correction, deletion, or removal of his or her personal information?
- Will information stored in the system be shared with others?
- How and how often is the service tested for security vulnerabilities?
- How can someone from the public report a security issue?
